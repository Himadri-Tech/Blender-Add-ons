### The most powerful free muscle system for Blender — used by indie artists and AAA studios alike.

This add-on turns hours of manual muscle sculpting + rigging into **two clicks**.

Generate real, deformable, physics-driven muscles between any two bones — with automatic flex, jiggle, and perfect clothing interaction.

## Features

- One-click muscle generation between any two selected pose bones  
- Realistic cylinder-based muscles with proper origin & insertion  
- Dual Hook modifiers → perfect stretching & squashing  
- Full Soft Body physics optimized for organic muscle behavior  
- Automatic "Muscle_Pin" vertex group (ends stiff, belly soft)  
- Global "Muscle Tension" slider (0 = rock hard → 1 = max flex)  
- Weight Paint mode for fine control (Blue = flexible, Red = stiff)  
- Two intelligent Dynamic Paint systems:  
  - **Motion Painter** → muscles auto-soften where they move fast (biceps pump, glute bounce)  
  - **Compression Stiffener** → flesh auto-stiffens under bras, armor, belts, hands → zero clipping forever  
- Bake & export ready (works in renders, game engines, etc.)

Used in the same way as Spider-Verse, God of War Ragnarök, Arcane, Horizon, and modern Marvel films — now free for everyone.

## Installation

1. Download `generate_muscle_system.py`  
2. Open Blender → Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install  
3. Select the file → Enable "Generate Muscle System"  
4. Done! Panel appears in Properties → Physics tab

## How to Use (30-Second Workflow)

### Generate a Muscle (e.g., Biceps)
1. Select your armature → go to Pose Mode  
2. Select two bones (e.g., upper arm + forearm)  
3. Go to Properties → Physics → Generate Muscle System  
4. Click **"Generate Muscle"**  
5. A perfect biceps appears with physics ready!

### Make It Flex Realistically
- Use the Tension slider (lower = harder flex)  
- Click "Paint Muscle Areas" → paint the belly softer (blue)  
- Or click "Motion Painter" → play animation → biceps auto-softens on movement!

### No More Clipping Under Clothing
1. Select your bra/armor/belt + the muscle  
2. Click **"Compression Stiffener"**  
3. Play animation → flesh perfectly squashes against clothing!

### Finalize
Click **Bake** → your muscle simulation is cached and render-ready.

## Roadmap (v2.0+)
- Muscle presets (Biceps, Triceps, Quads, Glutes, Abs, Pecs)  
- One-click full upper body / lower body generation  
- Tapered & anatomical muscle shapes  
- Integration with skin binding (Corrective Smooth support)  
- Export presets for Unreal Engine / Unity
